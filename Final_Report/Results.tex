\section*{\textsc{\Large Results}}

The first two diagrams show results for the different algorithms running for up to 8 threads with high contention. The slower system does not have results for some of the algorithms at 8 threads as they skew the graph significantly and remove valuable data.

The next graph shows the faster system running from 8-16 threads with high contention.

\bigskip

The last graphs again compare the faster and slower system but in this case analyze a low contention scenario.
