\section*{\textsc{\Large Introduction}}

	When programming for multiprocessor/multithread computers, it is necessary to implement locking systems to prevent from overwriting shared resources.  During our class we have already seen multiple locking mechanisms.  We see that there are many ways to provide security for objects in our programming.  
	
	We have written and tested multiple locking systems to investigate where some locks perform well and where others do not.  The locks tested were the Java Reentrant Lock, CLH Queue Lock, MCS Queue Lock, Lamport Bakery Algorithm, Eisenberg \& McGuire Algorithm and Szyma\`{n}ski's Algorithm.  
	
	Some of the tests performed are based off the number of cores available in the system, the amount of memory the system has, the number of threads being used, etc.  These statistics allow us to compare the performance of the lock with the method used to develop to lock.
