\section*{\textsc{\Large Proposed Solution}}

In addition to the locks that we develop for assignments in class, we will implement (NUMBER HERE) other locks to do performance comparison. Additionally early testing will be done to determine a case where there is not a dominiant performer and develop a hybrid lock that will best meet the specific needs of this case.

(yeah i know that this needs more but well talk tomorrow like during lunch and crank it out)
